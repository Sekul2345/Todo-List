# To-Do List Application

A simple and interactive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks and delete them dynamically.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to append it to the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task comes with a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The app is styled with a modern design using CSS.
- **Responsive Interaction**: Button hover effects and input focus transitions enhance the user experience.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the to-do list.
- `index.css`: The CSS file providing styling for the to-do list.
- Inline `<script>`: JavaScript code for handling the add and delete functionality.
